    <h1>About StepStyle</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Step into comfort. Step into style.</p>

    <p>
      StepStyle is a curated footwear showcase platform designed to help users
      explore a wide variety of branded and stylish footwear in one place.
      Our goal is to present clean, organized, and detailed product information
      so users can make confident buying decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not sell products directly. Instead, StepStyle acts as a discovery
      platform, redirecting users to trusted online marketplaces such as Amazon
      for secure purchasing.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      To create a simple, elegant, and user-friendly footwear browsing experience
      that focuses on design clarity, product presentation, and ease of access.
